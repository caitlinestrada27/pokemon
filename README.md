# Pokémon Lab

#### Introduction: 
I created this project for my AP Computer Science A class at Isidore Newman High School. The project features multiple classes including player and pokémon constructors to facilitate a duel ran in the main file. 

#### Tech Stack:
This project was created using Java and IntelliJIdea. 

#### Features:
The winner is determined by randomly generated attack values based on the level, health, and other factors of the player. 

#### Process:
While this started out as an assignment, I found the game super fun to recreate and added lots of extra functionality before submitting it. 

#### Learnings:
This project taught me so much about the significance of using classes in Java. It exemplifies the importance of default values and constructors. Additionally, it gave me valuable practice in importing class types
and constructors into the main file.
